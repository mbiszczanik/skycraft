.SYNOPSIS
    Pester 5 tests for tools/guide-drift/parse.py, the guide-to-steps parser of the guide drift tool.

.DESCRIPTION
    The parser is Python standard library only, so this suite runs on the ubuntu-latest runner
    without a browser. Two kinds of test:

      FIXTURES - small guides written here, parsed through a temp file, asserting the rules of
      issue #189: only '### Step X.Y.N:' sections are read; fenced code is skipped; where a step
      has '#### Option N:' headings only Option 1 is read (plus the step's Expected Result);
      bold spans that are not UI elements are dropped; 'A -> B' chains become navigation;
      Field | Value tables become fields; images are collected with their pixel width.

      THE 17 GUIDES - every module-*/X.Y-*/lab-guide-X.Y.md parses, its step ids match its
      headings in order, and every step marked portal has at least one label. This does NOT
      enforce the multi-modal structure of docs/lab-guide-standards.md section 5; only 3 guides
      use it today.

    -ForEach cases are computed at discovery time (file scope), as every suite in this directory
    does; fixtures are parsed in BeforeAll, because It blocks cannot see file-scope variables.

.EXAMPLE
    Invoke-Pester -Path .\tests\Guide-Drift-Parser.Tests.ps1
