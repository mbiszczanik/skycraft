# Module 1: Manage Azure Identities and Governance (9 hours)

## 📚 Module Overview

In this module, you'll establish the **foundational security layer** for the SkyCraft deployment. 
You'll create the identity structure, implement role-based access control, and configure governance policies 
that protect your infrastructure and enforce organizational standards.

**Real-world Context**: Before deploying any infrastructure, you must control *who* can access resources, 
*what* they can do, and *enforce* compliance standards—exactly what we'll do here for the SkyCraft team.
