# Module 2: Implement and Manage Networking (12 hours)

## 📚 Module Overview

In this module, you will build the **virtual network backbone** for SkyCraft. You'll create a secure, segmented network architecture that allows game servers to communicate while protecting them from unauthorized access. You'll also implement global connectivity, name resolution, and load balancing to ensure a seamless player experience.

**Real-world Context**: A game server is only as good as its network. High latency, poor routing, or security vulnerabilities can ruin the player experience. In this module, you'll build a production-grade network topology that mirrors enterprise standards.
